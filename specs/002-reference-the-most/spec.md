# Feature Specification: PreToolUse Interception for Morph Fast-Apply

**Feature Branch**: `002-reference-the-most`  
**Created**: 2025-09-07  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "reference the most recent comment on github issue #2 for a structured plan to completely rearchitect the system to function the way it needs to."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, when I ask Claude to make an edit to a file, MorphLLM should intercept the request, perform the edit, and apply the changes directly to the filesystem, ensuring that Claude's standard file write operations are skipped.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** Claude receives an edit request, **When** the `PreToolUse` hook intercepts it and MorphLLM successfully applies the changes, **Then** the file is updated by MorphLLM, and Claude's standard edit operation is skipped.
2. **Given** Claude receives an edit request, **When** the `PreToolUse` hook intercepts it but MorphLLM fails to apply the changes, **Then** Claude's standard edit operation proceeds as a fallback.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when MorphLLM returns empty or invalid edit results? (Should fall back to Claude's standard edit or log an error).
- How does the system handle non-file edit operations (e.g., `read_file`)? (Should not be intercepted).

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST intercept Claude's file edit requests *before* they are applied to the filesystem.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST route intercepted edit requests through MorphLLM FastApply.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST apply the results from MorphLLM directly to the filesystem.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST prevent Claude's standard file write operations when MorphLLM successfully handles an edit request.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST gracefully fall back to Claude's standard file write operations if MorphLLM fails to apply the changes.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST provide a `MorphEditInterceptor` class to encapsulate the core interception logic.
- **FR-007**: The system MUST provide a `PreToolUseHook` class to integrate with Claude's `PreToolUse` mechanism.
- **FR-008**: The system MUST update `src/core/backend.ts` to support the interceptor's interaction with MorphLLM.
- **FR-009**: The system MUST provide a main export point (`src/index.ts`) for Claude integration.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **EditRequest**: Represents the intercepted edit request, including goal and target files.
- **EditResult**: Represents the outcome of the MorphLLM application, including success status, number of edits, and files modified.
