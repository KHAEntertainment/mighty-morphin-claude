# Contract Test Outline: MorphEditInterceptor

## Purpose
To verify that the `MorphEditInterceptor` class adheres to its defined contract, specifically its ability to intercept and apply edit requests via MorphLLM and handle success/failure scenarios.

## Test Cases

### Test Case 1: Successful Interception and Application
- **Description**: Verify that `interceptAndApply` successfully processes an `EditRequest` and returns a successful `EditResult`.
- **Preconditions**:
    - Mock MorphLLM FastApply to return a successful response with valid modifications.
    - Mock filesystem write operations to succeed.
- **Steps**:
    1. Create a sample `EditRequest`.
    2. Call `MorphEditInterceptor.interceptAndApply(editRequest)`.
- **Expected Outcome**:
    - The returned `EditResult` should have `success: true`.
    - `modifiedFiles` and `diffs` in `EditResult` should match the mocked MorphLLM output.
    - Filesystem write operations should have been called with the correct content.

### Test Case 2: MorphLLM Failure
- **Description**: Verify that `interceptAndApply` correctly handles a failure from MorphLLM FastApply.
- **Preconditions**:
    - Mock MorphLLM FastApply to return a failed response (e.g., an error message).
- **Steps**:
    1. Create a sample `EditRequest`.
    2. Call `MorphEditInterceptor.interceptAndApply(editRequest)`.
- **Expected Outcome**:
    - The returned `EditResult` should have `success: false`.
    - The `error` field in `EditResult` should contain the mocked error message from MorphLLM.
    - Filesystem write operations should NOT have been called.

### Test Case 3: Filesystem Write Failure
- **Description**: Verify that `interceptAndApply` handles errors during filesystem write operations after a successful MorphLLM response.
- **Preconditions**:
    - Mock MorphLLM FastApply to return a successful response.
    - Mock filesystem write operations to throw an error.
- **Steps**:
    1. Create a sample `EditRequest`.
    2. Call `MorphEditInterceptor.interceptAndApply(editRequest)`.
- **Expected Outcome**:
    - The returned `EditResult` should have `success: false`.
    - The `error` field in `EditResult` should contain details about the filesystem write error.

## Mocking Strategy
- Use a testing framework (e.g., Jest) to mock external dependencies like MorphLLM FastApply communication and filesystem operations.
