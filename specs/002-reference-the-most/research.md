# Research for PreToolUse Interception for Morph Fast-Apply

## Summary
Based on the provided feature specification, no explicit "NEEDS CLARIFICATION" markers were present, and the core mechanisms (PreToolUse hook, MorphLLM FastApply interaction) are defined by the required classes (`PreToolUseHook`, `MorphEditInterceptor`). Therefore, no specific research tasks were identified as critical blockers for initial planning.

## Decisions & Rationale

### 1. Claude's PreToolUse Hook Mechanism
- **Decision**: Assume standard Claude `PreToolUse` hook integration points as implied by the feature specification. The `PreToolUseHook` class will encapsulate this interaction.
- **Rationale**: The spec directly calls for a `PreToolUseHook` class, suggesting the integration point is known or will be discovered during implementation. No further research is needed at the planning stage.

### 2. MorphLLM FastApply Interaction
- **Decision**: Assume MorphLLM FastApply provides a clear API for receiving `EditRequest` and returning `EditResult`. The `MorphEditInterceptor` class will manage this interaction.
- **Rationale**: The spec defines `EditRequest` and `EditResult` entities, implying a well-defined interface for MorphLLM. The `MorphEditInterceptor` is designed to abstract this interaction.

### 3. Fallback Mechanism
- **Decision**: The fallback to Claude's standard file write operations will be handled within the `PreToolUseHook` or `MorphEditInterceptor` by allowing the original operation to proceed if MorphLLM fails or returns an invalid result.
- **Rationale**: This is a core functional requirement and can be designed into the interception logic without further research.

## Alternatives Considered
- **Deep dive into Claude's internal APIs**: Rejected for the planning phase as the spec implies a high-level integration via a hook. This level of detail is for implementation.
- **Detailed performance benchmarking**: Rejected for the planning phase. Performance goals are not explicitly stated, and initial implementation will focus on functionality. Benchmarking can be done in a later phase.
