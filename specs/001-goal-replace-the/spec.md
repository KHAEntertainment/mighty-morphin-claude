# Feature Specification: Claude-Code Native Integration for Morph Fast-Apply

**Feature Branch**: `001-goal-replace-the`  
**Created**: 2025-09-07
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Goal: Replace the git-hook approach of the current project state with a Claude-Code‚Äìnative integration that auto-runs Morph Fast-Apply after code edits, plus a manual /morph-apply command and a proactive subagent. The installer must ask whether to install Globally (~/.claude), Project-only (.claude), or Both, and then provision the right files/config for each target. Detailed guideline for this implemntation is here @/Users/bbrenner/Documents/Scripting Projects/mighty-morphin-claude/docs/upgrade-guide.md"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer using Claude-Code, I want to have my code edits automatically merged using Morph Fast-Apply so that I don't have to manually resolve conflicts and can maintain a clean code structure. I also want to be able to manually trigger the merge process and be prompted to use it when appropriate.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a developer has installed the integration, **When** they edit a file using a Claude-Code tool (Edit, Write, MultiEdit), **Then** the changes are automatically merged into the file using Morph Fast-Apply.
2. **Given** a developer has installed the integration, **When** they run the `/morph-apply` command with a description and file path, **Then** the described change is merged into the specified file.
3. **Given** a developer has installed the integration, **When** they edit a file, **Then** a subagent proactively suggests using `/morph-apply` to merge the changes.
4. **Given** a developer runs the installer, **When** they choose a project-only installation, **Then** the configuration is written to `.claude/` in the current project.
5. **Given** a developer runs the installer, **When** they choose a global installation, **Then** the configuration is written to `~/.claude/`.
6. **Given** a developer runs the installer, **When** they choose both, **Then** the configuration is written to both locations.

### Edge Cases
- What happens if the `MORPH_LLM_API_KEY` is not set?
- What happens if the merge fails?
- What happens if the user runs the installer with `--noninteractive`?
- What happens if the user runs the installer with `--uninstall`?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST provide an interactive installer that allows users to choose between project, global, or both installation scopes.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST automatically trigger a Morph Fast-Apply merge after a user edits a file with `Edit`, `Write`, or `MultiEdit` tools.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST provide a `/morph-apply` slash command for manual merges.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST include a proactive subagent that suggests using `/morph-apply` after code edits.
- **FR-005**: The installer MUST handle `MORPH_LLM_API_KEY` by either using the environment variable or prompting the user to store it securely.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST provide a smoke test to verify the hook functionality.
- **FR-007**: The system MUST update the README with instructions for the new features.
- **FR-008**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: The spec mentions removing old git-hook logic as optional. Should this be a requirement?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Configuration**: Represents the settings for the integration, including hooks, commands, and agents. Can be stored at the project or global level.
- **Hook**: A script that is triggered by a Claude-Code event (e.g., `PostToolUse`).
- **Command**: A user-invokable action (e.g., `/morph-apply`).
- **Agent**: A proactive assistant that can suggest actions.
